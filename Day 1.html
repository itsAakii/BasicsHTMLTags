<h1>1st Generation Computer</h1>
<p>The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. 
The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). 
These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently.</p>

<h2>2nd Generation Computer</h2>
<p> A transistor computer, now often called a second generation computer,
 is a computer which uses discrete transistors instead of vacuum tubes. 
The first generation of electronic computers used vacuum tubes,
 which generated large amounts of heat, were bulky and unreliable</p>

<h3>Third generation computers</h3>
<p>Third generation computers were computers that emerged due to the development of the integrated circuit (IC).
 They were the first steps toward computers as we know them today.
 Their main feature was the use of integrated circuits, 
 which allowed them to be shrunk down to be as small as large toasters.

<h4>4th Generation Computer</h4>
<p>The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used 
Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements with their 
associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.</p>

<h5>5th Generationion Computer</h5>
The Fifth Generation computers are defined as the computers which will be used predominantly in 1990s. 
Supercomputers will be used in scientific and engineering calculations and simulations.
 Database machines and present mainframe computers will be networked in order to organise worldwide information systems.
